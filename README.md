# Mirabilis-Jalapa-Flower_or_Four-o-clock-flower-Detection

About Model and Algorithm:

Here, Mirabilis Jalapa also known as Four o'clock flower is detected with custom Mirabilis Jalapa flower dataset using YOLOv5 algorithm's YOLOv5m model .Yolov5 is a very effective object detecting method.Yolov5 algorithm is used in code by cloning from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git

The code is executed in Google Colab.Notes are added in the code for uploading images and labels of custom dataset , yaml file and other processes.

Custom dataset and labels ,yaml file and results are given here.

The mAP@.5 is 0.921 after training the model.

About Dataset: 

Information:

It has medicinal properties .It's root is purgative ,diuretic and also it's juice is used for treating fevers,diarrhoea,indigestion.Also root is used for muscular swelling, scabies and menstrual disorder problems.It's leaves are also used for reducing inflammation.The flowers are used for making natural dye. It has many more benefits.

Reason For Choosing:

I have used Mirabilis Jalapa flower for detection because it has many medicinal properties that are very effiective and object detection model easily helps to identify this useful plant.
